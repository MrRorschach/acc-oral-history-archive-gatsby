The **ACC Oral History Project** is a remarkable endeavor led by **Bill Montgomery**, a distinguished figure who has been with ACC since its founding in 1973. With his deep knowledge of the institution's history and unwavering dedication, Montgomery has played a pivotal role in shaping this extraordinary archive. Assisting him in the recording and production of the interviews is the fantastic **Victor Sibaja-Molina**, manager of the Instructional Media Production team at ACC. Victor's expertise and meticulous attention to detail ensure that each interview is captured with utmost clarity and authenticity. Together, Montgomery and Sibaja-Molina have orchestrated a remarkable collaboration that safeguards the invaluable narratives within the ACC Oral History Project, immortalizing the voices and experiences that have shaped the college's enduring legacy.
